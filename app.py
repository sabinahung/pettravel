                        A general certificate of health is not required by CDC for entry of domestic cats into the United States, although some airlines or states may require them. However, cats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry into the United States if they have evidence of an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans. If a cat appears to be ill, further examination by a licensed veterinarian at the owner's expense might be required at the port of entry.

                    - Cats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination for importation into the United States. However, CDC **recommends that all cats be vaccinated against rabies**, and your [US destination](https://www.nasda.org/about-nasda/state-agriculture-departments/) may have additional requirements.

                    - All pet cats arriving in the [state of Hawaii](http://hawaii.gov/hdoa/ai/aqs/info) and the [territory of Guam](http://ns.gov.gu/pets.html), even from the US mainland, are subject to locally imposed quarantine requirements.
